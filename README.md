![Airplane Window](airplanewindow.png)

  A narrative text game for the Game Boy Color created as part of [Global Game Jam 2019](https://globalgamejam.org/2019/games/postcards-afar).  In Postcards From Afar, you play a traveler halfway around the world from their lover, each on a separate journey with vastly different experiences. As you proceed through your personal narrative you collect "moments" and then you choose which of those moments to share with your lover via postcard. How do you relate to one another? What stories do you tell? Do you keep things light, talk about your troubles, or share your feelings? Can you maintain your connection to home even when you are a world apart?
